			<p><b>My Winter Vacation</b></p>
			<p>On the first day on my winter break, my grand and grand-grandparents came over to our house to celebrate my father’s birthday. After dinner, we had fun playing games. Later that evening, the lights went off because of the freezing rain. It was no fun anymore and our guests had to go home.</p>
            <p>On Sunday, December 22nd, I went to my piano classes. The lights were still off, but my father bought a generator. While my parents were busy warming up the house, I was watching Russian movies about Fixiky, Barbosking, and some others. It was a cold day.</p>
            <p>On Monday, December 23rd, I went to my grandmother’s house. She invited me to stay at her place until Christmas. Together we went to the pool. I love going to the pool. On Tuesday, December 24th, we went to the pool again. Later, we went to play tennis and a game that we made up. In the evening, we cooked dinner together. I left a snack and note on the table for Santa asking for a microphone, a hockey game, and a dress. When I woke up the next day, I noticed that Santa ate the snack that I left him and wrote back to me, “OK. SANTA” I was surprised. Santa left presents under my grandmother’s tree and under my tree at home. I got more than I wished for. I was so happy.</p>
            <p>On Thursday, December 26th, I went to my piano classes, and then my parents and I went to Liza’s house to celebrate Christmas. There was a boy, but it was fine. On Friday, December 27th, I went tubing with my parents at Horseshoe Resort. I went more than 100 times up and down the hill. I love tubing. </p>
            <p>On Saturday, December 28th, I went shopping with my parents. We bought presents for our friends. On Sunday, December 29th, I went to visit my grand-grandparents downtown. We made decorations for the New Year’s party. We had fun playing games. My grand-grandparents were so happy to spend the day with me. The next day, Liza and I had a play date at my house. We opened a shop. It was called, “Love & Pet”, we had fun playing.</p>
            <p>On December 31st, we had a New Year’s party at our house with our friends. We sang songs, played games, and had fireworks. The people spent all night partying at our house. When we were partying, “Dedyshka Moroz” (Russian Santa) left a helicopter for me under the palm tree, instead of the Christmas tree. It was so funny.</p>
            <p>On the first day of January, 2014, my family and I watched movies and played Nerf Rebelle, Jenga, Scrabble, and completed a hard puzzle. On Thursday, January 2nd, we had another party with my grand-grandparents. They came over for dinner. We played Jenga together, had a snowball fight, and shot arrows. I love my grand-grandparents. I’m always nice when they come to visit us.</p>
            <p>On Friday, January 3rd, I went to my grand-grandparents’ house again. They have a swimming pool in the building they live in. My parents and I went for a swim. After, we had dinner that my grand-grandfather cooked.</p>
            <p>On Saturday, January 4th, my family and I went for a nice winter walk. During our walk, we visited the library, since I had to return the books I borrowed. I borrowed new books. It was a lovely day. The last day of my winter break, I spent my day preparing for school, which I missed a lot.</p>

			<p><b><i>The Karate Mouse</i></br>by Geronimo Stilton</b></p>
			<p>This book is about a new adventure of a mouse named Geronimo, who is a newspaper publisher. Geronimo gets to compete in the Karate World Championship with the help of his sports mouse friend.</p>
            <p>My favourite part of this book is when Geronimo becomes a new world champion even though he was just a publisher mouse who likes to write adventure stories.</p>
            <p>I would recommend this book to a friend because it is a great adventure story. I would give this book five stars.</p>

			<p><b>My Baby Brother</b></p>
			<p>My life has changed a lot starting this summer because my baby brother was born. His name is Milan. When I wake up I run into my brother’s room to see his morning smile. He always smiles at me, but the morning smile is the best.</p>
            <p>My baby brother is the cutest when he rolls from one side to another holding his little toes. His toes remind me of my dolly’s toes.</p>
            <p>I am so proud of my brother because he can sit on his own at four months of age. I like to take care of my brother by bathing him, playing with him, reading stories to him, and watching him when my mom is cooking dinner.</p>
            <p>I love my baby brother because he is the best brother in the world. When he grows up I want him to read my writing about him.</p>

			<p><b>My Punta Cana Vacation</b></p>
			<p>I spent my winter vacation with my parents in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. We stayed at the Bávaro Princess Resort for fifteen days. It was on the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
			<p>Punta Cana is a beautiful place with many palm trees, flowers and different birds and animals. Some of these animals are peacocks, herons, flamingos, snakes, monkeys, rabbits, big spiders, and big snails. I went over there with my father. It was a very interesting.</p>
            <p>Once, we went on a trip to Saona Island, which is a big island with a blue lagoon. Saona Island is in the Caribbean Sea. I saw starfish when I was at the island. My favourite trip was to Dolphin Island Park. Dolphins were in the water around us. We touched them and one dolphin sang a song for us. Another dolphin gave me a ride. I was very happy and it was fun.</p>
            <p>I went swimming every day. The water was warm. I love swimming. My New Year’s Eve was the best that I have had because I was with my father! We went to a restaurant and had dinner. Then we went to the disco with my friend Alice. My winter vacation was very good!</p>

			<p><b>My Favourite Park</b></p>
			<p>I moved to Toronto from Almaty City in Kazakhstan. Almaty is a very beautiful city surrounded by very high mountains; called Tyan-Shyan Mountains. You can see white snow on the top of the mountains even during the summer when it is very hot.</p>
            <p>There are many parks and aqua parks with many kinds of attractions in Almaty. One of them is close to my place where I lived. It is a nice, small park with pine and oak trees and lots of flower beds with roses.</p>
            <p>I went to the park with my friends, who lived close to me. On our summer holidays, we played in the park. We rode our bicycles, roller skated and skateboarded. We played football, badminton, basketball, and many different games like; “Vishibaly,” “Bashmachok,” “Pushkin Street,” and “Moscow Hiding.”</p>
            <p>Sometimes, we took place in art competitions with coloured crayons on asphalt. I liked it very much. Once I won a prize; a t-shirt and a toy. My favourite prize was stickers of art square.</p>
            <p>During the winter, the park administration put a big Christmas tree with decorations and lights in the middle of the park. They made a skating rink and slide mountains. All my friends and I were having fun on sleds and skates. </p>
            <p>I love my park and I miss my friends.</p>

			<p><b>My Winter Vacation</b></p>
			<p>My winter break was a lot of fun. On December 24th, I went with my mommy to a family gathering. At the family gathering I made two new friends, Brenden and Samie. Brenden is six years old and Samie is nine years old. We played hide-and-seek and ran with the dog.</p>
            <p>I went with my mommy to Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada and the CN Tower on the same day. At the aquarium, I went to many different galleries. I went to Rainbow Reef, Dangerous Lagoon, The Gallery, Ray Bay, and Planet Jellies.</p>
            <p>At Mel Lastman Square, I went skating with Sandy. I saw Liza and her Brother. We played games with each other. From December 27th to 29th, I went to my cousin’s house from day to night. There were four kids there. I played with a crossbow and with a dog.</p>
            <p>On New Year’s, I went to a basketball game. It was the Raptors vs the Pacers. The Raptors won. I sat on the courtside. I was on T.V. I went to the Nutcracker during my winter break. I did not like it because they did not talk; they were only dancing.</p>
            <p>I had my first hockey game in 2014 and we lost 3-4. I saw a hockey game on the television at home. It was Canada vs Russia. Russia won. I had a busy and fun winter break.</p>

			<p><b><i>A Beauty of a Plan</i></br>by Angela Shelf Medearis</b></p>
			<p>The title of the book is <i>A Beauty of a Plan</i>. The author is Angela Shelf Medearis.</p>
            <p>This book is about a girl name Sheila. Sheila dreamed about being an architect, but her grandmother wanted Sheila to be a hairdresser in her beauty salon. Sheila decided to prove to her grandmother, that her woodworking shop classes would help her design a new look for the beauty salon. Sheila had only three weeks to make this project, or else she would have to drop out of her shop class and sweep the salon for one month. If Shelia’s grandmother liked the plan, then her grandmother would sweep the salon by herself for one month.</p>
            <p>My favourite part of the story was when Sheila made a plan to design a beauty salon for her grandmother. This is my favourite part because I think it will surprise her grandmother. I also liked when Sheila had her peers from her shop class help with the project because it will make her a better architect.</p>
            <p>I would recommend this book to my friends because it teaches us about teamwork. I would give this book five stars.</p>

			<p>Would you like to build cool projects like birdhouses, wooden airplanes, fire trucks, or even more?</p>
            <p>Home Depot offers many interesting workshops for kids of different ages. I attended the Fire Rescue Workshop with my mom and received an orange apron. There were five children of ages five to twelve and an instructor who helped us build an airplane.</p>
            <p>There are six steps to make a wooden airplane.</p>
            <p>Step 1: Hammer the top wing.</p>
            <p>Step 2: Hammer the propeller into the body of the airplane.</p>
            <p>Step 3: Glue the horizontal part of the tail into the back of the plane.</p>
            <p>Step 4: Glue the vertical part of the wing to the back of the plane.</p>
            <p>Step 5: Put the stickers on the side of the plane.</p>
            <p>Step 6: Glue and hammer the wheels.</p>

			<p>My favourite part of my winter vacation was that I had lots of play dates with Edwin! I had one on January 3rd and we played games. We played Super Mario 3-D, Mario Soccer and Tickets to Ride.</p>
            <p>Edwin and I were also pretending we were pillows. We made up a language when we were playing games. We were fighting when we lost and happy when we won, but we were pretending.</p>
            <p>I spent the whole day with Edwin; from 1:35 to 9:30pm. I spent the whole day with Edwin because my mommy was in the hospital to visit my daddy. When my mommy and I got home I ate Kraft macaroni. My play date was fun!</p>

			<p><b>My Winter Vacation</b></p>
			<p>On my winter vacation I was at home on the first, second, and third day and we were playing. On the next day, there was no electricity and we stayed at home. My sister and I went to camp, while my mom and dad were packing to go to a hotel because there was no electricity.</p>
            <p>After we went to another hotel, which we were planning for, it was called “Splash Lagoon”. It is a gigantic water park. I went there with one of my friends. It had seven water slides and two hot tubs. It had a wave pool that was huge.</p>
            <p>There are three hotels connected to Splash Lagoon; Holiday Inn, Comfort Inn, and Residence Inn. I was in Holiday Inn. Splash Lagoon is the sixth largest water park in North America and the third largest in the United States. I went on all the water slides. I had a lot of fun.</p>
            <p>On the New Year my friends came to my house, and after we slept we got presents. I got Lego and a 3-D glow in the dark pirate ship. I built the Lego faster than my mom could wake up. I liked my presents.</p>
            <p>Then we went skating with my friends in a park with an ice rink. We all started crashing into each other. I then went tobogganing. I didn’t even need a sled because I went on my butt. It was icy the whole way down. I went skating again with my friends. </p>
            <p>I had a play date with Ryan. First, I showed him my presents and then we started playing on the Wii U. Then we ate and then we played another game for a really long time. I had a really fun Christmas this year.</p>

			<p><b><i>Arthur Makes the Team</i></br>by Marc Brown</b></p>
			<p>This book is about how Arthur was playing baseball and thought that everybody was better than him because they played last year. It was Arthur’s first year playing baseball and his mom and dad told him that he is a good player compared to everyone else.</p>
            <p>My favourite part of the book is when there was a baseball game. Arthur watched the first two pitches; one was a strike and the other was a ball. The team Arthur played against won and they were cheering in victory.</p>
            <p>I would recommend this book to a friend because Arthur learns that he can be a really good baseball player. I would give this book five stars.</p>

			<p><b>My Winter Vacation</b></p>
			<p>My favourite part of my winter vacation was when we celebrated New Year’s. We had all kinds of stuff on the table. All the food on the table was good.</p>
            <p>After that came the cake. One was called “Mishka”, a cake with chocolate and vanilla. The second cake was a wheat cake that didn’t look like it had wheat. The third cake was a lemon cake. It had lemon slices on top of it. There was also candy with the cakes.</p>
            <p>I also made three flags. They were presents for my parents and grandparents. I made the Canadian flag, the flag of France, and the flag of the United States. The flag of Canada was my parents’ present and the flag of France was my grandparents’ present. I really hoped that they would like it and they did. My wish came true!</p>
            <p>Through the whole party, the television was on. When everyone was done eating and drinking, we all went to the T.V. for the continuation of the New Year’s countdown. When it was only eight seconds left, everyone started counting down, “eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!” After, the T.V. showed fireworks. The real fireworks were at Niagara Falls.</p>
            <p>The next day, I woke up really early to see my New Year’s Day present. I got a bead/jewelry making kit and two Russian books.</p>

			<p><b>My Labour Day Weekend</b></p>
			<p>On the Labour Day weekend, I went to Montréal. Our hotel was called Hotel du Fort. We went to different museums. One of the museums had lots of things made out of glass. Another one was a Botanical Garden and a train museum.</p>
            <p>All of the trains looked so old, but there were some trains that you could go inside of and a few play trains that you could play in. Inside of one play train there was a train memory match game and costumes of some people that take care of trains and drive trains. There was a train hill where you are the train and you go under a hill. Another game had a giant cube where you throw or roll the cube. When the cube stops you go to the picture that is on the floor that matches the picture you see on top.</p>
            <p>I really want to go to Montréal once more because it is super fun there. The only thing that I don’t like is that it takes us three or more hours to drive.</p>

			<p><b>My Winter Vacation</b></p>
			<p>My winter vacation started with the plane ride to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. It was long, but we finally got there. Next, my family and I got our bags. Then we went through all the security. It was very hot in the Punta Cana airport. We finally got on the bus to go to the hotel. It was called, “The Reserve”. We went to a restaurant called, “The Grill”. I ate pork chops and they were very tasty. </p>
            <p>The next day I had French toast for breakfast. It was very good. Then we went to the beach with our friends. To our surprise, they took us snorkeling. We went on a boat and drove to the reef. I saw different kinds of fish. There were yellow fish, striped fish, big fish, and many more.</p>
            <p>Later on, we went to play in the sand. It was warm and perfect to make castles with. We went for a walk on the beach and saw a sand castle that was built amazingly. The sand castle was so cool.</p>
            <p>All the restaurants were amazing. I loved the one called Fuego. I had spaghetti with meat sauce there. We went to shows and concerts at night. My favourite one was called “Boogie Night”. It was my favourite because of the musical number YMCA. </p>
            <p>I also played tennis with my coach, Andy. Sadly, my vacation came to an end. I was sad, but I was glad to be home again.</p>

			<p><b>My Winter Vacation</b></p>
			<p>I went to Miami by plane. It was a three hour flight. When we got to Miami, we went to the cruise by taxi. It was a huge, black Disney cruise ship. The inside of the ship was beautiful. I saw Mickey and Minnie walking around and people were taking pictures with them.</p>
            <p>Then I went to the Oceaneer Lab and I saw a big T.V. and many computer games. There were lots of kids playing there. I was driving the ship in the lab and I played games. It was fun.</p>
            <p>There were lots of fun activities for kids on the ship. There was a big pool with slides on the top deck of the ship. The slide had twenty steps and I could see the pool from the top. When it was my turn, I waited for the green light and slid down on my belly. At the bottom of the slide I fell into the pool. It was so much fun. I got hungry and I ate two hotdogs with fries. I enjoyed it a lot. There was a movie playing in the pool area.</p>
            <p>At nighttime, there was a pirate party and firecrackers at the top deck. I can’t wait to go on another cruise with my family.</p>

			<p><b><i>Puff the Magic Dragon</i></br>by Peter Yarrow and Lenny Lipton</b></p>
			<p>This book is about a dragon. His name is Puff. He is a magic dragon who lives by the sea. Puff meets Little Jackie Paper and they become friends. They like to play on the water and have fun together.</p>
            <p>My favourite part is when Puff and Little Jackie Paper are in a boat and see dolphins. This is my favourite part because I like dolphins. I do not like when Puff is alone because he is sad.</p>
            <p>I would recommend this book to a friend because it is a good book. I give Puff the Magic Dragon five stars.</p>

			<p>I went to LegoLand and I went on the rides. Then I went on the roller coaster and I shot all the targets. I saw the CN Tower and I saw a soccer game that was made of Lego.</p>
            <p>I went to Blue Mountain and I went to the swimming pool. I enjoy diving. Then I went to paint a muffin. I went to a place and made a gingerbread house and put icing on top and ate it.</p>
            <p>I went to African Lion Safari and I saw a monkey. He jumped on our car. I saw a baby monkey hanging from her mommy’s tummy and drinking milk. That was interesting for me.</p>
