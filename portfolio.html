                <h2>Education</h2>
                <h3>Faculty of Education; B.Ed., Primary/Junior, University of Western Ontario</h3>
                <p>My year at the Faculty of Education at the University of Western Ontario was very successful. The faculty taught me how important it is to work collaboratively with my peers in the teaching profession. I was able to learn useful teaching strategies from the experienced teachers for my teaching practicums, as well as, develop a confident teacher persona in the classroom. My passion for teaching grew even stronger throughout these experiences and has helped shape the teacher I am today.</p>
                <h3>Additional Qualification - Special Education Part 1: Elementary, OISE/UT</h3>
                <p>I have learned a great deal from the Special Education Part 1 Additional Qualification course. I am more confident in my knowledge on exceptionalities and the strategies one can use to accommodate exceptional students. This course has not only taught me possible strategies I can use with students with exceptionalities; it has taught me valuable strategies that can be used to benefit all students in a classroom.</p>
                <h3>Faculty of Health; B.Sc.,Spec. Hons. Kinesiology & Health Science, York University</h3>
                <p>My undergraduate program at York University helped me to develop crucial work ethics, such as efficient studying and work habits. The knowledge I obtained from York’s Kinesiology and Health Science program has strengthened my ideals on healthy living. I will in turn be able to teach and model for my students; the meaning of being healthy.</p>

                <h3 style="line-height:1.2em;">Develop student pride and a sense of involvement</h3>
                <p>The most important part of teaching is getting students to take control of their learning by developing pride and a sense of involvement in their own education. This ownership of education can be accomplished through a welcoming, learning environment and interactive teaching strategies that will engage students and develop their full potential.</p>
                <p>I believe it is crucial for teachers to create a learning environment where students have a sense of community, feel safe to take risks in sharing their ideas, are supported in leadership roles, and are appreciated for their individuality.</p>
                <p>Once this safe and welcoming learning environment is established then students are comfortable to take ownership of their education through interactive, hands-on lessons. My experiences have taught me that students enjoy learning when they take an active role and when they have opportunities to explore and make connections between the curriculum and the world. Keeping students engaged and motivated in school is the key to building a child’s educational foundation, which will provide them the building blocks they need to reach their full potential.</p>

				<h3 style="line-height:1.2em;">I follow the Ethical Standards as outlined by the OCT</h3>
                <p>I believe that as a teacher, it is important to be committed to enhancing professional knowledge in order to promote student learning.</p>
                <p>Creating a learning environment where students feel safe and supported to take risks in leadership roles, collaborate with peers, and reach their full potentials is a key component of a successful classroom. I am able to do this by following the Ethical Standards and Standards of Practice for the Teaching Profession that the Ontario College of Teachers outlines.</p>
