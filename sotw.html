            <p><b>Plot Summary:</b> Emmet touched the “thing” when it said, “Do not touch!” Then Emmet fell into the portal and saw the man upstairs.</p>
            <p><b>Favourite Part:</b> My favourite part is when Emmet touched the “thing” because the “thing” was attached to his back. This made him special, which made me happy.</p>
            <p><b>Favourite Character:</b> My favourite character is Emmet because when he is given instructions, he must listen to them and follow them. I like this because he does not make mistakes when he is building.</p>
            <p><b>Rating:</b> I would give this movie five stars because I like how Emmet is the special construction worker and I like the couch he made.</p>
