          <h4>My experience at St. Mary’s was valuable in developing my teaching strategies</h4>
          <p>My four week full day kindergarten teaching practicum with St. Mary’s Catholic School was an excellent opportunity to practice and further develop the teaching strategies I had learned throughout the year at Western’s Faculty of Education.</p>     
          <p>I created hands on and interactive lessons for the kindergartens. They were all enthusiastically involved and actively learning. It was very rewarding to see the kindergartens make connections during lessons and reach their potential. This practicum confirmed my beliefs that teachers are a crucial facilitator for building the foundation of a child’s successful education.</p>
          <h2>Kindergarten</h2>
          <h4>All students were actively involved in their education</h4>
          <p>My third and final teaching practicum was in the full day junior and senior kindergarten classroom at St. Mary’s Catholic School. This teaching practicum was four weeks and I was responsible for teaching the full day.</p>
          <p>I created a dance unit for physical education, as well as, teaching the students cooperative games. I introduced new art techniques to the students during visual arts and incorporated art in a religion lesson on Easter. I taught interactive lessons for math and science, which engaged all students and got them actively involved in their education. I taught the kindergartens language arts as well, which included understanding rhyming words, unit theme class story writing, and book studies. All lessons and units were based on criteria from the Ontario curriculum.</p>
          <h3>Rhyming Words</h3>
          <p>These are examples of student work for the rhyming lesson. I read a rhyming story to the students, then as a class we discussed what rhyming words meant and tried to find some in the story. Then I gave students the sentence &quot;Now I am &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I can do &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;.&quot; As a class we brainstormed action words that rhyme with five and six. Each student had to pick an action word that rhymed with their age to fill in the sentence and then draw a picture.</p>
          <h3>Physical Education</h3>
          <p>This is an example of a lesson plan I made for the kindergartens. I taught students about relay races and taught them new cooperative games. Students learned how to participate and work as a team during these lessons.</p>
          <h3>Theme Work</h3>
          <p>Here are some examples of student work from the dinosaurs unit theme work. To promote story writing, as a class, we thought of a creative dinosaur story. I wrote the story on chart paper, but had students volunteer to write the sight words for me. I found this activity was very engaging and the students loved to hear their story.</p>
          <p>Through our discussion on dinosaurs, students had learned that dinosaurs hatch from eggs. To have students make connections between dinosaurs and other animals, I created a lesson where the students created a class book based on animals that came from eggs.</p>
          <p>The final piece of student work shown in this section is an example of the art I incorporated in our theme work. Students went around the classroom and coloured their dinosaur body pieces by crayon rubbing different surfaces.</p>
