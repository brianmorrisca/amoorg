            <p>&quot;She easily adapted to routines already in place within the classroom, and helped to create a safe and productive learning environment for the students.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;When Amanda began her student teaching, it was immediately evident that she had a love for the profession and a sincere interest in and concern for the students.&quot;</p>

          <h4>My experience at Evelyn Harrison confirmed my passion for teaching</h4>
          <p>My three week grade two teaching practicum with Evelyn Harrison Public School was an excellent first teaching experience. I learned valuable classroom management skills and teaching strategies that engaged the students.</p>
          <p>Creating science, social studies and art lessons that would incorporate the individual needs of all the students was challenging, but rewarding at the same time. It was gratifying as a teacher to observe the individual growth of students and realize the immense responsibility you have in a child’s education. My successful experience with Evelyn Harrison confirmed my love for teaching and showed me the importance of a good teacher in the education system.</p>
          <h2>Grade Two</h2>
          <h4>I created an interactive science unit on bears and a social studies unit on mapping</h4>
          <p>My first teaching practicum was in a grade two classroom at Evelyn Harrison Public School. This teaching practicum was three weeks and I was responsible for teaching a third of the day.</p>
          <p>I created an interactive science unit on bears and a social studies unit on mapping; I assessed students on both of these units. I was in charge of the daily calendar routine and I taught some lessons in visual arts. My practicum teacher provided prep coverage for a grade six class and I was able to plan and deliver two word study lessons on adjectives using the book, &quot;<em>Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs</em>&quot; by Judi Barrett. All lessons and units were based on criteria from the Ontario curriculum.</p>
          <h3>Science</h3>
          <p>Here are some examples of student work from the bear unit I created for science, as well as, a lesson plan. Throughout the unit, I taught the grade two students about the brown bear, polar bear and American black bear. They learned about the characteristics and habitat of each of these bears. Students were able to explain the differences and similarities between each of these bears.</p>
          <h3>Social Studies</h3>
          <p>These are examples of student work from the mapping unit I created for social studies, as well as, some lesson plans. I taught students about various aspects of a map, such as, a compass rose, symbols, and a legend. Students learned the difference between a globe and a map and when each is used. To actively engage students in the mapping unit, I created activities where they created maps of the classroom and their bedrooms.</p>
          <h3>Visual Arts</h3>
          <p>Here are some examples of the grade two’s art work and lesson plans I developed for visual arts. I used the art styles of Edvard Munch and Pablo Picasso to teach the students about expressionism and cubism. Students were very engaged in these art projects and were proud to put their art work on display within the school’s walls.</p>
