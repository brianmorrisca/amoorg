            <p>&quot;She learned to think on her feet and develop a stronger teacher presence in a very active classroom.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;She worked hard and strove to deliver lessons that were both interesting and effective. It was a pleasure working with Amanda and I wish her continued success.&quot;</p>

          <h4>My experience at Chippewa taught me the importance of interactive learning</h4>
          <p>I learned a significant amount about teaching in my three week grade four teaching practicum with Chippewa Public School. I enjoyed experiencing the curriculum in the junior division and especially valued the strategies I learned. I was able to further develop my classroom management with the very active grade four class.</p>
          <p>The most valuable technique I learned from this experience was the importance of interactive lessons and activities. Through the interactive, hands on multiplication lessons I prepared, students were able to understand the meaning of multiplication; not just memorize their multiplications table. The students were in power of their learning and were more enthusiastic. This experience was very rewarding as a new teacher.</p>
          <h2>Grade Four</h2>
          <p>My second teaching practicum was in a grade four classroom at Chippewa Public School. This teaching practicum was three weeks and I was responsible for teaching half the day.</p>
          <p>I created an interactive mathematics unit for multiplication and assessed students in this unit. I created lessons in Balanced Literacy and conducted informal reading conferences with individual students during independent reading time. I taught a visual arts lesson, which integrated with their social studies unit on Medieval Times. All lessons and units were based on criteria from the Ontario curriculum.</p>
          <h3>Language Arts</h3>
          <p>Here are some examples of anchor charts I used in Balanced Literacy and some lesson plans. I created word study lessons, where students reviewed the meaning of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs through interactive activities.</p>
          <p>The shared reading and writing lessons I created focused on point of view and personal recount from both a reader and authorâ€™s perspective. I used the books, &quot;<em>Dear Mrs. LaRue: Letters from Obedience School</em>&quot; by Mark Teague and &quot;<em>Voices in the Park</em>&quot; by Anthony Browne to help convey the concepts of point of view and personal recount.</p>
          <h3>Mathematics</h3>
          <p>Here is an example of an anchor chart I built with the students during the multiplication unit and some lesson plans from the unit. Throughout the multiplication unit I created interactive lessons to explain the meaning of multiplication.</p>
          <p>Each lesson we explored a new fact strategy and broke it down to understand the meaning, instead of memorizing it. Once students understood the meaning, they were able to see the connections between fact strategies.</p>
          <h3>Visual Arts</h3>
          <p>This is an example of the visual arts lesson plan I made up for the grade fours. They created individual, personalized coat of arms, which integrated their knowledge from the Medieval Times unit they were learning about in social studies.</p>
