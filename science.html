            <h2>Science &ndash; Structures Experiment Overview</h2>
            <p>The grade 2 students are exploring structures and what makes structures strong and stable.  Students will take a fun, hands-on journey to discover and further develop their understanding of structures. Check back to see the experiments we have investigated.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Experiments</h2>
            <br />
            <h3>Spaghetti and Marshmallow Tower Experiment</h3>
            <p>Students were given the task to design and build a tower out of spaghetti and mini marshmallows. The towers needed to be sturdy and strong enough to stand on its own. Students quickly learned that using a combination of squares and triangles enabled the tower to stand on its own. Sophie, Eva, and Edmond had the tallest tower standing at 50cm. This group used their time productively and were able to make two stable towers.</p>

            <h3>Plasticene Bridge Experiment</h3>
            <p>Students were given the task to design and build a bridge out of plasticene. The bridge had to span a distance of at least 15cm and it had to support its own weight. Students came across difficulties with building a bridge that would not sag or break. Working as a team, each group was able to identify the bridge's weaknesses and improve these to build a stronger bridge.</p>

            <h3>Newspaper Bridge Experiment</h3>
            <p>Students were given the task to design and build a paper bridge that could bear a load. The bridge could only be built with newspaper and masking tape and it had to span a distance of 40cm. Students used their knowledge of structures to build bridges with good support. Both groups completed the task and had bridges that could hold a load of more than 15 chapter books.</p>

            <h3>Tin Foil Boats Experiment</h3>
            <p>Students were given the task to design and create three different boats of varying style using a 15 cm by 15 cm piece of tin foil. The goal of this experiment was to build a boat that would hold the most number of counters. The boats the grade twos made were able to hold between 20 and 60 counters. After the experiment, students discussed positive and negative aspects of their boats.</p>

            <h3>Cantilever Experiment</h3>
            <p>A cantilever is a projecting structure supported at one end only, such as a balcony, shelf, or diving board. Students were given the task to build a strong cantilever out from the wall that could hold a weight of 20 grams without collapsing. Each group was given 200 drinking straws and a roll of masking tape. Groups planned and sketched their cantilevers prior to building. While building, students quickly learned their designs would have to be altered in order to be a stable cantilever. Students worked together to build and over come obstacles.</p>

            <p>Students were given the task to design and build a strong and stable structure that will hold a load (book) for at least 30 seconds. The materials given to each group were popsicle sticks and plasticine. Edwin and Eva were the only group to build a structure that was strong enough to hold a book. Their structure held the book for longer than one minute. Students reflected on their structures and discussed what they would change to improve their structures.</p>

            <p>Students explored three different materials to test the strength of each for the frame of a structure. Students tested the strength of wooden craft sticks, short straws, and long straws as posts and beams. The grade twos concluded that the short straws were strongest as posts and the wooden craft sticks were strongest as beams.</p>

            <h3>Marshmallow and Toothpick Experiment</h3>
            <p>Students explored the meaning and importance of posts and beams in structures by building a stable structure out of marshmallows and toothpicks. Students were given 40 minutes to build the tallest, stable structure. Each structure was measured to determine the tallest structure. </p>
			<p>Students quickly learned the importance of a foundation while building their structures vertically. Partners worked together to discuss the best design for their structures. Below are the results.</p>
