            <h2>Science &ndash; Plants Experiment Overview</h2>
            <p>The grade 2 science course will focus on “Plants” throughout the entire first term. Students will become familiar with the specific parts of a plant, examples of plants that we eat, what a plant needs in order to grow and change, as well as, the important role plants play in our environment.</p>
            <p>Plants <b>KWL</b> (What I <b>K</b>now, What I <b>W</b>ant to Know, What I <b>L</b>earned):</p>
            <a href="img/science-kwl-large.jpg"><img src="img/science-kwl-small.jpg" width="200" height="187" alt="Science KWL" /></a>
            <p>The sepal is what the students know about plants and the flower petals is what the students want to know. At the end of the term, we will add what the students have learned about plants.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Experiments</h2>
            <p>The grade 2 students will explore the growth of plants by performing hands on experiments. Stay posted for updates on how our plants are growing.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>Lima Bean and Lentil Experiment</h3>
            <p>We will be exploring the process a plant takes to grow from a seed to a plant by comparing how lima beans and lentils grow. Each student is growing their own lima bean and lentil plant. Students are responsible for their seeds and will ensure that the seed is watered and has sun light.</p>

            <br />

            <p>As a class we are also investigating the importance of a plant’s four basic needs: water, sun light, soil, and nutrients. We have three separate cups that will test this.</p>
            <p><b>Cup #1:</b> The lima beans and lentils receive water and sun light.</p>
            <p><b>Cup #2:</b> The lima beans and lentils receive water, but no sun light.</p>
            <p><b>Cup #3:</b> The lima beans and lentils receive water, but no water.</p>

            <p>The lima bean and lentil seeds start to germinate. The radicle has begun to grow on most of the students’ seeds.</p>

            <p>Germination continues with the lima bean and lentil seeds. Both seeds have begun to sprout stems and leaves.</p>

            <p>The lima beans and lentils continue to grow. The next step is to transplant our plants into soil, to continue growth and provide nutrients.</p>

            <p>The pictures to the right show the difference between a plant that received sunlight and a plant that did not receive sunlight. The grade twos have observed that plants can grow without sunlight, but the growth is not similar.</p>
            <p><b>Left Picture: The lentils on the left received sunlight and water. The lentils on the right received water, but no sunlight.</b></p>
            <p><b>Right Picture: The lima beans on the left received sunlight and water. The lima beans on the right received water, but no sunlight.</b></p>
